# What is SLO?

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are a key part of site reliability engineering (SRE). They are a way to define the level of service that a service provider agrees to provide to its customers. SLOs are a way to measure and track the performance of a service, and they are used to set expectations for the reliability and availability of the service.
