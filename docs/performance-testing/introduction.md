# What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing is a type of testing that is used to measure and evaluate the performance of a system or application. It is a way to determine how well a system performs under different conditions, such as heavy load, high traffic, or other stress factors. Performance testing is used to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks, and to ensure that a system can handle the expected load and traffic.
