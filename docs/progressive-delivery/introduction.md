# What is Progressive Delivery?

Progressive delivery is a set of practices and techniques that enable teams to release new features and updates to their applications with greater speed, safety, and control. It is a way to deliver software in a more incremental and iterative manner, allowing teams to test and validate changes in production before rolling them out to all users.
