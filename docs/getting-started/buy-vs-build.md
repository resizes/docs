# Buy vs Build

When considering the implementation of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), organizations face a critical decision: should they buy a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution or build a custom one in-house? This document outlines the key considerations, advantages, and disadvantages of both approaches to help stakeholders make an informed decision.

## Introduction

An IDP streamlines and automates the software development lifecycle, improving efficiency, standardizing processes, and enabling developers to focus on coding rather than operational complexities. The decision to buy or build an IDP involves evaluating factors such as cost, time, customization, and scalability.

## Considerations

Before making a decision, consider the following:

- **Current and Future Needs**: Assess the specific requirements of your development teams and how well they align with available COTS solutions or the effort needed to build a custom solution.
- **Budget**: Consider both the upfront and ongoing costs associated with buying or building and maintaining an IDP.
- **Time to Market**: Evaluate how quickly you need the IDP to be operational and how this aligns with the development time for a custom solution versus the deployment time for a COTS solution.
- **Technical Expertise**: Assess the in-house expertise available for building and maintaining a custom IDP versus the support and updates provided with a COTS solution.
- **Integration**: Consider how well a COTS solution can integrate with existing tools and workflows versus a custom solution designed to fit seamlessly into your environment.

## Advantages of Buying

1. Speed of Deployment: COTS solutions can be deployed relatively quickly, offering immediate improvements in development processes.
2. Reduced Initial Cost: Buying often requires a lower upfront investment compared to the resources needed to develop a custom solution.
3. Professional Support and Updates: Vendors provide ongoing support, maintenance, and updates, ensuring the platform stays up-to-date with the latest technologies and security standards.
4. Proven Solutions: Commercial platforms are often well-tested and reliable, having been used and vetted by multiple organizations.

## Disadvantages of Buying

1. Limited Customization: COTS solutions may not perfectly fit every organization's unique needs, leading to compromises in functionality.
2. Ongoing Costs: Subscription fees, licensing costs, and costs for additional features or users can add up over time.
3. Dependency on Vendors: Changes in vendor strategy, pricing, or support can impact the use and effectiveness of the platform.

## Advantages of Building

1. Customization: A custom-built IDP can be tailored to meet the exact requirements of the organization, offering a perfect fit for existing workflows and technologies.
2. Flexibility: Changes and updates can be made as needed, allowing the platform to evolve with the organization's needs.
3. Integration: A custom solution can be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing tools and systems, minimizing disruption and maximizing efficiency.

## Disadvantages of Building

1. Higher Initial Cost: The upfront investment in terms of time, resources, and money can be significant when building a custom solution.
2. Maintenance and Support: The organization is responsible for ongoing maintenance, updates, and support, requiring dedicated staff and resources.
3. Risk of Delays and Overruns: Developing a custom solution comes with the risk of project delays, cost overruns, and potential failure to meet expectations.

## Conclusion

The decision to buy or build an IDP should be based on a thorough analysis of the organization's specific needs, resources, and strategic goals. Buying a COTS solution may be the best option for organizations looking for speed, lower initial costs, and proven reliability. Conversely, building a custom IDP might be the preferred choice for organizations requiring maximum customization, flexibility, and integration with existing systems.

Ultimately, the decision involves balancing immediate needs with long-term goals, considering the total cost of ownership, and assessing the ability to adapt to changing requirements. Organizations may also consider a hybrid approach, combining COTS solutions with custom-built components to achieve the optimal balance of efficiency, customization, and cost-effectiveness.
