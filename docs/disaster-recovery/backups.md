# What is a Backup?

A backup is a copy of data that is stored separately from the original data. Backups are used to restore data to its original state after data loss or corruption. Backups are essential for disaster recovery and data protection. They are used to recover data in case of hardware failure, software failure, data corruption, accidental deletion, or other data loss events.
