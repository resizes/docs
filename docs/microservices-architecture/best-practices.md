# Best Practices

Microservices architecture is a powerful approach to building scalable, flexible, and resilient applications. However, designing, implementing, and managing microservices comes with its own set of challenges. This documentation outlines best practices for microservices architecture, aimed at helping developers, architects, and platform engineers build and maintain successful microservices-based applications.

## The Twelve-Factor App

The Twelve-Factor App is a set of best practices for building modern, cloud-native applications. It provides a comprehensive guide to designing applications that are scalable, maintainable, and resilient. The principles of the 12 Factor App are particularly relevant to microservices architecture, as they emphasize the importance of decoupling, automation, and flexibility.

## DORA Metrics

The DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are a set of key performance indicators that measure the effectiveness of software development and delivery processes. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of microservices-based applications, helping teams identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.
