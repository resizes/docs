# What is GitOps?

GitOps is a paradigm or a set of practices that emphasizes the use of Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of the delivery pipelines, every change is comprehensible, traceable, and can be audited for changes to the infrastructure or applications.

:::note
The OpenGitOps project is a community-driven initiative to define and promote GitOps best practices. The project aims to provide a set of guidelines, best practices, and tools to help organizations adopt GitOps practices. Check out the [OpenGitOps website](https://opengitops.dev) for more information.

## Introduction to GitOps

### Definition

GitOps is an operational framework that takes DevOps best practices used for application development, such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to infrastructure automation. The name "GitOps" stems from the idea of using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

### Benefits

- **Improved Deployment Frequency**: Automating deployments to allow for faster iterations.
- **Enhanced Security**: Using Git's built-in audit trails and review processes for change management.
- **Better Stability**: Declarative setups improve system stability and reduce configuration drift.
- **Faster Recovery**: Quick rollback and recovery capabilities thanks to version control.

### Components

- Git repository as the source of truth.
- CI/CD pipelines for automation.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for infrastructure management.
- Observability tools for real-time monitoring.

## Core Principles of GitOps

- **Declarative Configuration**: Everything required to run an application or system is defined declaratively.
- **Version Controlled, Immutable Storage**: Git repositories store all configurations, ensuring immutability and version control.
- **Automated Delivery**: Automated processes apply changes from the Git repository to the production environment.
- **Software Agents to Ensure Correctness**: Software agents continuously observe the production environment to align with the Git repository's state.

### Key Components of GitOps

**Git Repository**

Acts as the central point of truth, storing all configurations, scripts, and manifests. It's structured to support multiple environments and facilitate easy rollbacks.

**CI/CD Tools**

Automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions are commonly used.

**Infrastructure as Code Tools**

Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes manifests allow for the declarative specification of infrastructure.

**Observability and Monitoring**

Incorporate tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to ensure that the actual system state is continuously monitored and deviations are detected early.

## Implementing GitOps

**Setting Up a Git Repository**

- Structure your repository to separate infrastructure, configuration, and application code.
- Use branches to manage environments and promote code through stages.

**Choosing the Right Tools**

- Evaluate tools based on compatibility with your stack, community support, and ease of integration.

**Defining the CI/CD Pipeline**

- Automate testing and deployment processes.
- Ensure pipelines are triggered by Git events like commits or tags.

**Security Considerations**

- Implement access controls and review processes for the Git repository.
- Manage secrets securely using tools like HashiCorp Vault.

**Rollbacks and Disaster Recovery**

- Design systems for easy rollback using Git’s revert or reset.
- Plan for disaster recovery by automating infrastructure recreation from the Git repository.

## Best Practices

**Branching Strategies**

- Adopt branching models like GitFlow or trunk-based development to fit your team’s workflow.

**Change Management**

- Require peer reviews for changes.
- Use merge requests or pull requests as a gate for changes to enter the production environment.

**Observability**

- Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting.
- Ensure that discrepancies between desired and actual states trigger alerts.

## Tools and Platforms

- **Flux**: A GitOps operator for Kubernetes that ensures the cluster state matches the configuration stored in Git.
- **ArgoCD**: A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
- **Jenkins X**: A CI/CD solution for cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

GitOps is a powerful paradigm that leverages Git's capabilities to manage infrastructure and applications. By adopting GitOps practices, organizations can improve deployment speed, enhance security, and ensure system stability. With the right tools and practices in place, GitOps can transform the way teams manage and deploy their systems.
