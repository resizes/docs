# Profiling

Profiling is the process of analyzing the performance of a system to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Profiling can be used to identify performance issues, such as slow response times, high CPU usage, and memory leaks. Profiling tools can be used to collect data about the performance of a system, and to analyze that data to identify performance issues.
