# Tracing

Tracing is the process of tracking the flow of requests through a distributed system. It is a critical part of understanding the performance and behavior of a system, and is used to diagnose and debug problems. Tracing can be used to identify bottlenecks, latency, and errors in a system, and to ensure that a system is performing as expected.
