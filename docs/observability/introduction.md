# What is Observability?

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. It helps to understand the behavior of a system by analyzing its outputs. Observability is a key concept in the field of control theory, which is the study of how to control systems. It is also a key concept in the field of systems engineering, which is the study of how to design and manage systems.
