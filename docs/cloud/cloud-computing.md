# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a technology that allows individuals and organizations to access computing resources (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis. This means you can use as much or as little of the services as you need without having to invest in and maintain physical hardware and software infrastructure. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, making it a pivotal element in digital transformation and platform engineering.

## Types of Cloud Computing

There are three main types of cloud computing services, often referred to as the cloud computing stack because they build on top of one another. These are:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In this model, cloud providers offer servers, storage, and networking hardware, along with the software layer to run it, such as the hypervisor. It gives users the highest level of flexibility and management control over their resources. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure VMs.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers an environment for developers and IT professionals to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It includes tools and services designed to make coding and deploying applications much more efficient. Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Services.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. SaaS providers manage the infrastructure, platforms, and software, and users simply access the software via a web browser. This is the most familiar form of cloud service for many users. Examples include Google Workspace, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office 365.

## Types of Cloud Deployment

Cloud computing services can be deployed in different ways, depending on the needs of the user. These are:

- **Public Cloud**: Services are delivered over the public internet and are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.

- **Private Cloud**: Services are maintained on a private network and are only accessible by a single organization. This model offers more control over the infrastructure and is best suited for organizations with strict security and compliance requirements.

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model is best suited for organizations that want to use the public cloud for non-sensitive operations and the private cloud for sensitive operations.

- **Multi-Cloud**: Uses two or more cloud computing services in a single architecture. This model is best suited for organizations that want to avoid vendor lock-in, reduce the risk of downtime, and have more flexibility in choosing the best cloud services for their needs.

Understanding these basics of cloud computing and the types of cloud is fundamental for Platform Engineering, as it informs decisions on deploying, managing, and scaling applications and services efficiently in the cloud.
